Input Data: Amalthea System Model
=================================

AMALTHEA system models (APP4MC_) are used to describe hard- and software of embedded (distributed) systems. The meta-model used in AMALTHEA is comparable to the model used in TORO, allowing for descriptions of tasks, resources and cause-effect chains. A parser has been added enabling use of AMALTHEA system descriptions in TORO's analyses. Note that not all AMALTHEA models can be used. Constraints are outlined in [4].

An exemplary AMALTHEA model has been created and added to the tool, showcasing the parsers capabilities.
